# Project Description
This project is Credit Card Fraud detection using  Light GBM. It is relatively new algorithm. Light GBM is the best fit for this kind of dataset. It is  one of the best performing model if we use itâ€™s parameters accordingly as it has faster training speed and very good accuracy.

The dataset for this is downloaded from kaggle.You can download from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?select=creditcard.csv)
